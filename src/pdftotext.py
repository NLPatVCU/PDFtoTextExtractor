Documentation
THe script extracts text and saves it to a text file it is not good with tables but works with text that is either
one column or two columns. There are two libraries used PYPDF2 and pdfplumber PyPDF2 does the extraction and pdfplumber
recognizes if the pdf is one or two column(if the pdf has two pages in one like a book)

Also don't worry about the PdfReadWarning that happens when the table is not formatted correctly
